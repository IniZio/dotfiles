Environment:

- Ubuntu 16.10 (Yay i broke my elementary os,,,)
- [i3wm](https://i3wm.org) (Love the Vim-like navigation, I use hjkl instead of default jkl; because of habits)
- VS Code (Dont mess up its not the fked up Visual Studio. Used mostly frequently among my editors)
- Spacemacs (Used more frequently than nvim recently)
- [Nvim](https://neovim.io/) (literally future of vim, I not advanced enough to feel the awesome differences though)
- [ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/) (better completion experience, better command history keeping, and oh-my-zsh!)
