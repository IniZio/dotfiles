# Not just .* Files

### Setup:

1. Clone the contents right into home directory
2. Run `sh ./.setup/setup.sh` and then let's pray that it runs til the end

### Environment:

- Ubuntu 17.10 + Budgie Desktop / i3wm / Gnome
- [i3wm](https://i3wm.org) (Love the Vim-like navigation, I use hjkl instead of default jkl; because of habits)
- [ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/) (better completion experience, better command history keeping, and oh-my-zsh!)
- Fira Code, [Input Mono](input.fontbureau.com/): Best Programming fonts
- [Powerline's Mono fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts): All nice fonts for terminal e.g. Hack, SourceCode Pro, RobotoMono
- Product Sans: Nice Desktop font

### Gadgets:

- ~~[Gcalcli](https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli) : google calendar on CLI~~ Too gimicky
- TLP: save battery
- [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky): I use it for showing gcalcli on desktop
- ~~Spacemacs (Used more frequently than nvim recently)~~
- Spacevim (Spacemacs is too heavy, this is out-of-the-box)
- [Nvim](https://neovim.io/) (literally future of vim, I not advanced enough to feel the awesome differences though)
- [Atom IDE](https://ide.atom.io/) (Eye candy)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (More useful than atom in terms of autocomplete, somtimes hiccup with insane delays tho)

- NaSC: Not as powerful as WolframAlpha, but well sometimes you have to be offline..
- Meld: Compare files/directories, good for dirty comparisons
- Redshift GTK / flux indicator applet (in ubuntu repo already): Save your eyes
- ~~Insync: sync your google drive~~ Eats battery
- [Take a Break](http://ppa.launchpad.net/vlijm/takeabreak/ubuntu/pool/main/t/takeabreak/) / [Pomodoro](http://gnomepomodoro.org/): er... yea take a break
- [Temps](https://jackd248.github.io/temps/): Beautiful weather applet
- Genymotion: faster emulator than Android AVD (only free for personal use with limited features though)

- [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/): use pointers for large files in git repo to save local space
- [Etcher](https://etcher.io/): USB writer with a finally good UI
