My Linux dotfiles

Environment:

- [Elementary OS Loki](elementary.io) (Ubuntu 16.04, Pantheon desktop gave me precious flawless desktop experience of Linux unlike other desktops, but...)
- [i3wm](https://i3wm.org) (Love the Vim-like navigation, I use hjkl instead of default jkl; because of habits)
- [Nvim](https://neovim.io/) (literally future of vim, I not advanced enough to feel the awesome differences though)
- [ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/) (better completion experience, better command history keeping, and oh-my-zsh!)
