// >> READ: Want to release a modified version of this performance config with your own changes? Please don't unless it's
// a major change from this one. Make a pull request for this config to help increase performance even more and
// keep everything working properly. If you're going to release a modified version anyway, please, at the very least,
// link back to this github page and state that you modified this config.

// Rhapsody's Performance Config - 7/24/15
// Launch options stated here. Copy these into TF2's launch options, and remove -dxlevel 90/-dxlevel 81 after the first launch,
// or else your graphics settings will keep reverting every time you restart the game.
// Fullscreen: -dxlevel 90 -full -w WIDTH -h HEIGHT -console -novid
// Windowed:   -dxlevel 90 -sw -w WIDTH -h HEIGHT -console -noborder -novid
// Fullscreen DX8: -dxlevel 81 -full -w WIDTH -h HEIGHT -console -novid
// Windowed DX8:   -dxlevel 81 -sw -w WIDTH -h HEIGHT -console -noborder -novid
// Don't use -dxlevel 95 with this config. I've attempted to, but for some reason, whenever you exit the graphics options with -dxlevel 95 enabled,
// it defaults back to -dxlevel 90 or even -dxlevel 80. I'm unsure as to what actually causes this, so I can't fix it unless there's some sort of reasoning
// I'm missing.

// >> PLEASE NOTE
// All of these settings, besides the Graphical and Miscellaneous section, can be changed in-game with commands.
// These changes will persist through restarts, since all of them are commented in this autoexec. Only edit/uncomment
// commented lines if you don't intend to use the console commands, since it's really not needed otherwise.
// If you want to edit the commands themselves, the aliases are listed towards the bottom of the file.

// >> HAVE YOUR OWN AUTOEXEC ALREADY, BUT WANT TO USE THE AUTOMATIC UPDATER?
// The automatic updater replaces the autoexec.cfg file with the updated version from the github repository, meaning any changes
// you make would be undone each time it grabs the current version. You can get around this by making a file called autoexec2.cfg
// in the same folder autoexec.cfg is in; as of 3/19/15, this script automatically executes autoexec2.cfg if it's found.
// Theoretically, you can place minor modifications to this script in that file separately, since I'd imagine autoexec2.cfg is
// executed after autoexec.cfg, since autoexec.cfg is the file that's executing autoexec2.cfg.

// >> KEEP UP TO DATE!
// Read the README.MD file included! It has instructions on how to set up an automatic updater on Windows or Linux so that you can
// keep this config updated automatically, since it changes to be compatible with the new TF2 updates. Alternatively, keep a close
// eye on https://github.com/RhapsodySL/perfconfig and possibly favorite the repo!
